## About

<p>a game called snake. Here you have to eat apples until you occupy all the space. I think everyone is familiar with this game.By switching to C#, I also improved my skills, so unlike the previous project in python, in my opinion this version of the game is much better. And this was not without problems. Either it’s the console and its size or my crookedness, but I don’t know why the console always leaves one line underneath, which is why the snake can enter the barrier with half of its body from below.</p>

## Installation

(if you have C# installed)
1. go to bin/Debug
2. downlaod and run SnakeGame.exe
   
<p>Don't forget to configure your console correctly!<br/>Personally, I used the exact 8x9 font (if you have the same ratios, then choose them!)</p>
